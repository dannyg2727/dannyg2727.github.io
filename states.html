<h1>State Website Review</h1>

<h2> <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska </a></h2>
<p> Nebraska is ranked #1 for me. Its the GOAT </p>
<ul>
  <li>It looks to be super professional. Extremely easy to navigate </li>
  <li>The box links are very eye pleasing. Just seem perfect to have. </li>
  <li>I like how it shows off their capital city. Makes it look like a clean city. </li>
  <li>The search bar is also very helpful and easy to navigate to wherever needed.  </li>
</ul>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Flordia </a></h2>
  <p>Flordia made rank #2 aka first looser </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The colors of the page are pleasing to see. Makes you think of Flordia </li>
    <li>Super basic website design </li>
    <li>Your not getting flooded with information like other states </li>
    <li>Found it weird that this state website ends in .com not .gov like the rest. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.alaska.gov/">Alaska </a></h2>
  <p>The middle child ranked at #3 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Its a bit outdated looking with it being super boxy. </li>
    <li>Does show the beauty of the state in the background really well </li>
    <li>I like how it has a spot for its tourists to check out </li>
    <li>Font is a tad small, but managable.  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.delaware.gov/">Delaware </a></h2>
  <p>Almost last place we got Delaware rank #4 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Its a blue state so had to knock it down over Alaska. </li>
    <li>The opening page was the most boring in my eyes to see. </li>
    <li>I don't like how it has a section just screeming at me about Covid. </li>
    <li>I really enjoyed the little dashboard of infomation that contains flag status, school notices, etc. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois </a></h2>
  <p>Last and definitely least Illinois ranks #5 </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Biggest reason why its last is because its a hard core blue state </li>
    <li>First thing I noticed was covid signs, and I'm over covid so its my enemy now.  </li>
    <li>The virtual assistance seems pretty cool and handy to have. </li>
    <li>Definitely encourcges its people to get the vaccine.   </li>
  </ul>
