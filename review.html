<h1>Hosts Review</h1>

<h2><a href="http://www.bluehost.com">Bluehost</a> </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Really easy to navigate around</li>
  <li>Different supscription plans availiable</li>
  <li>Can have a year option or three year option as wel</li>
  <li>Can very around $3 to $18 </li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn't pick Bluehost just because out of the 3 I have listed here its the smallest buisness.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.fatcow.com">Fat Cow</a> </h2>
<ul>
  <li>It has a funny awkward name</li>
  <li>Reminds me of kid websites</li>
  <li>All the colors really pop out</li>
  <li>Looks like it can costs anywhere from $10 to over $1,000.</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be pretty pricey so I wouldn't pick it for that reason.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Go Daddy</a> </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Super modern website</li>
  <li>Go Daddy seems to be more famous compared to others</li>
  <li>Oldest company when compared to FatCow, and Bluehost</li>
  <li>Pretty cheap, can be $0.99 to $14.99 </li>
</ul>
<p>I would pick Go Daddy. Its a pretty popular company, and seems to be pretty well priced. </p>
