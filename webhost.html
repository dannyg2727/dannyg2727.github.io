<h1>Website Review</h1>
<h2><a href="https://www.espn.com">ESPN</a></h2>
  <p>What I love most about the ESPN website is how convenient it is since I'm just a sports nerd. I like how I can find any news, scores, or standings all in one spot. Probably my most favorite
  feature is how it will auto reload the scores every few seconds. The only thing I'm not a huge fan of are the flashy pop up ads. The ads at times can be very huge and it just being obnoxious. </p>
<h2><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com">BestBuy</a></h2>

  <p>BestBuy has a great website. Its super userfriendly and just easy to navigate with. They also make the website super pleasing to the eye with the blue and yellow. It makes it feel super mellow. With BestBuy they have a super easy menu to use. You don't have to me an electronic geek to find items. You can search super bland words and they will find what you have. It also updates super quick. I've seen them sell out in items and I've seen it count down like it saying 3 items left, then couple seconds refreshing to say 2 left. Its just a great website that I've never had problems with mobile and on computer.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.walmart.com">Walmart</a></h2>

  <p>Walmart is the website which I hate. On mobile it has been far worse then on my computer. It will randomly change my home store while on the app, and put it to completely randomly store in another state.
    It will also have extreme lag issues. It also seems to glitch on in stock and out of stock items. I have added items to my cart when it says there is plenty in stock then it will load slowly and kick me off saying none are in stock. I also hate how they now let 3rd party sellers so they can jack up prices on items. I just try to avoid shopping on Walmarts website.
